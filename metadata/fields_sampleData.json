The values are always numeric, but are treated as a string and padded with leading zeroes so they must always have 4 digits.\r\n\r\nThere is no requirement that Site Numbers be assigned continuously or in any particular order. Regional or local organizations are thus free to allocate Site Numbers in any way they choose, as long as there is no duplication within a county or tribal area.  Be aware that a tribal land using a Site Number will also reserve that Site Number for the overlapping county.  Likewise, if a county has already reserved a Site Number, it cannot be used for an overlapping Tribal land.\r\n\r\nIf a new Site Number is needed for a site that may lay in multiple jurisdictions, all agencies should cooperate to assign a Site Number to ensure that the Number is unique within the county and, for example, an ovelapping Tribal land. In other words, when a new Site Number is assigned, it must be different from any other Site Number already existing for that combination of State Code and County Code and Tribal land.\r\n\r\nA specific Site Number is associated with a specific physical location (latitide and longitude). Any change in location requires a new Site Number to be assigned (unless a waiver is obtained from the apporpriate regional office). Although a location change would routinely mean a new Site Number, some changes that do not change the site's location in respect to surrounding sources and its measurement scale may require no change. An EPA regional office should be consulted for assistance in determining whether a new site Number is required.  AQS also has the ability to \"link\" sites.  This allows the time series of data (used for NAAQS and other purposes) for a parameter to be considered continuous even if the site moved and the Site Number changed.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}, {"field_name": "parameter_code", "field_description": "The AQS code corresponding to the parameter measured by the monitor."}, {"field_name": "poc", "field_description": "This is the \"Parameter Occurrence Code\" used to distinguish different instruments that measure the same parameter at the same site.  There is no meaning to the POC (e.g. POC 1 does not indicate the primary monitor).  For example, the first monitor established to measure carbon monoxide (CO) at a site could have a POC of 1. If an additional monitor were established at the same site to measure CO, that monitor could have a POC of 2. However, if a new instrument were installed to replace the original instrument used as the first monitor, that would be the same monitor and it would still have a POC of 1.\r\n\r\nFor criteria pollutants, data from different sampling methods should only be stored under the same POC if the sampling intervals are the same and the methods are reference or equivalent. For sites where duplicate sampling is being conducted by multiple agencies or by one agency with multiple samplers, multiple POCs must be utilized to store all samples.\r\n\r\nFor non-criteria pollutants, data from multiple sampling methods can be stored under the same POC if the sampling intervals are the same and there is only one sample for the time reported. If multiple open path monitors are reporting data for the same parameter, each open path would be assigned a different POC.\r\n\r\nWhile there are no national EPA practices assigning POC values, there may be regional or agency conventions where a POC value may have specific significance.  Since these do not apply universally, you will likely get the wrong set of monitors assuming the POC represents something.  There is enough metadata avaialable in AQS to correctly classify all monitors (e.g., primary, speciation, etc.)\r\n\r\nNumbers do not need to be assigned sequentially."}, {"field_name": "latitude", "field_description": "The angular distance north or south of the equator measured in decimal degrees.
